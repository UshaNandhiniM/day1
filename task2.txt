1.  Objects, in JavaScript, are the most important data type and form the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 
                These objects are quite different from JavaScriptâ€™s primitive data types (Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined, and 
                symbol)in the sense that these primitive data types all store a single value each (depending on their types).
2.  Object()  can be called with or without new. Both create a new object.
3.  Object: An Object is a unique entity that contains properties and methods.
4.  he object can be created in two ways in JavaScript:
                 *Object Literal
                 *Object Constructor
5.   It is a concept in which some properties and methods of an Object are being used by another Object. Unlike most of the OOP 
                languages where classes inherit classes, JavaScript Objects inherit Objects i.e. certain features (property and methods) 
                of one object can be reused by other Objects.
